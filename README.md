## My Personal Vision

If we work together in a team, these are the behaviours and objectives which I care about most.

* Flourish
	* Be an intrapreneur
	* Relentlessly hunt for emergent value
	* Use your initiative - ask for forgiveness, not permission
* Leave your mark:
Bring yourself to what we do - your ideas, your experience; question, celebrate and improve with your team-mates. Make things
	* Faster
	* Better
	* More valuable
* Help it scale
	* Learn & share with those around you
	* Build the process
	* Apply what you learn

## Why do I care about any of this?
* We only get 1 life - let's show up while we can!
* People can be amazing, I'd like to pay attention and help them to thrive.
* Virtuous circles & emergence are a force of nature.
